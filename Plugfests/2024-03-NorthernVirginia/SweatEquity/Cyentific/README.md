# Cyentific Sweat Equity

Cyentific will demonstrate and provide technical support regarding the OCA subproject - [CACAO Roaster](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/cacao-roaster), including creating CACAO playbooks and supporting other sweat equity that will be brought in CASP. 

Further, we will demonstrate how CACAO interplays with STIX 2.1 and other standardized languages (e.g., at a command level with OpenC2, Kestrel, Sigma, etc.) and, in particular, showcase how we enrich the STIX 2.1 Course of Action object with CACAO playbooks and provide defenders with parsable and automatable workflows coupled with intelligence for additional context and in support of detection engineering. Our developed mechanism can accommodate playbooks in any open or proprietary format. You can find more details on a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyentific-rni/stix2.1-coa-playbook-extension).

Participants can install the CACAO Roaster on their machines/infrastructure or [can directly access the demo version provided by OCA](https://opencybersecurityalliance.github.io/cacao-roaster/).

## Brief Intro on CACAO Roaster
The OCA CACAO Roaster subproject is an open-source, community-driven web application that can be used to design, generate, modify, store, digitally sign and verify CACAO playbooks. 

CACAO is a standardized machine-processable framework for orchestrating and automating course-of-action playbooks in cybersecurity. It streamlines the creation, execution, and exchange of playbooks, making it easier for security teams to respond to incidents, mitigate threats, and protect their networks.
